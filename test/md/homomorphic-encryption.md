			- Scenario where one user holds private information
- Information about HE
	- Fast FAQ
	  collapsed:: true
		- Data enter / stay in / leave untrusted networks encrypted
		- Operations mixing ciphertext and plaintest reveal the secret?
			- No, the output is ciphertext
		- Is decryption performed during computation?
			- No, computation is performed without decryption
	- PHE vs SWHE vs FHE
		- Partially Homomorphic Encryption are schemes with only one operation enabled. Either sum or multiplication.
